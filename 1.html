  <h2>1. the Importance of a Goal</h2>

  <p>"Write once, run anywhere" Java was created with the above goals.<br>
    And I have a goal of giving you an interest in the language Java and Computer Science.</p>

<p>A goal brings many things. This GitHub, the space where I am writing now, is also the result of setting goals.<br>
   Many people would never have imagined that I could create a GitHub blog.<br>
   Because I created a GitHub account a day before the opening of the GitHub blog.<br>
   Blog quality is still not good, but anyway I made it!</p>

<p>You might think, "How does this article, which is more like a diary than a lecture review makes interest you?"<br>
  You may wonder what kind of support this is because it handles a very small part of the lecture<br>
  (only one sentence to exaggerate).<br>

<p>But people who don't have any information on the coding I've seen are terrified just by the word Java.<br>
 From that point of view, my article can give readers the impression that they are reading a coding-themed diary (or novel)<br>
and if exposed to coding through it, they will naturally become curious.<br>
Of course, I think it's true support that makes people who are not interested more interested than those who are already interested.</p>

<p>Think about artificial intelligence. These days, artificial intelligence is solidifying algorithms based on deep learning.<br>
  If someone asks me what the algorithm is, I'll answer 'how to achieve goal.'<br>
  This is because the solution we found to solve a particular problem is called an algorithm.<br>
  In other words, there must be a goal to come up with an algorithm.</p>

<p>If this was implemented with a particular algorithm, this means that there are some objectives(A).<br>
  In other words, A is needed to make intelligence.<br>
  To enlarge this, attempts to implement intelligence through algorithms come from the idea that our reason is likely to have been created for some purpose.</p>

<p>However, artificial intelligence, currently implemented in the above method, is still only a statistical tool.<br>
  The number of cases can be estimated without statistics, but it is just a product of mathematics.<br>
  Strong artificial intelligence may be implemented, but it seems far from being similar to "human."<br>
  Of course, there are no disagreement with the methodology of implementing something transcendence human beings.</p>

<p>But I think artificial intelligence will be implemented differently.<br>
  In particular, I believe that intelligence similar to 'human' will be implemented differently.<br>
  Through this, there is a question to answer, I have a goal.<br>
  I would like to first prove the existence of the question "the reason of our life,"<br>
  which precedes "the reason of our life(think, reason, else)."</p>

<p>There was an experiment with a small creature which has only 1,000 neurons called Caenorhabditis elegans.<br>
  We only implemented a network of random neurons in this small creature.<br>
  And there are what what seemed to be intelligence was implemented.<br>
  I think human intelligence has also been implemented through this process.<br>
  I think it is more likely that accidental connections have created reason so far.</p>

<p>However, even if the seed of all of our concerns above is "accidental", it is very important to set a goal.<br>
  Surprisingly, even the fact that “there is no goal” are found by the “goal” of revealing it.</p>

<p>I'm studying to see if artificial intelligence is implemented only physically.<br>
  Whether intelligence will be created solely by the supply of electric current<br>
  without the installation of software on very complex semiconductors.<br>
  Through this, I want to prove the existence of reason for life.<br>
  However, the process will definitely require 'artificial intelligence implemented by algorithms(software)'.<br>
  If my writing has stimulated your curiosity enough, I hope you will acquire basic knowledge in the
  <a href="https://www.boostcourse.org/opencourse" target="_blank" title="Boostcourse homepage">BoostCourse</a>.</p>

<p>*For reference, I said this opinion in the final interview of a software-related conglomerate.<br>
  And eliminated by an interviewer who did not know that<br>
  "Deep learning came from brain science, brain science came from philosophical ideas."<br>
  Don't be too fascinated to make a big mistake. Let's keep it between ourselves.</p>
