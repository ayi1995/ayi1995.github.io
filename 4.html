  <h2>4. Clear Definition</h2>

  <p>I have one thing to tell you. Now I don't even know basic codes,<br>
  actually I was a high school regional representative at the programming Olympiad.</p>

  <P>I can recall somethings while studying that I had forgotten, one of them is the data type.<br>
    When I was young, it was so annoying to process differently depending on the data type. <br>
    In fact, many of the errors that come out when debugging were as above. <br>
    Adding code carefully is not a difficult process,<br>
  but it was too boring. For us who study algorithms for ease of computation, <br>
  the above process is rather troublesome. That’s why I hated.</P>

  <p>There are difference between 1 and “1”. <br>
    1+1 is 2, but "1"+"1" is "11". <br>
    It does not seem important in the above example, <br>
    but if you confuse "1" with 1 it will lead to a big misunderstanding later. <br>
    In addition, you will not know what we are trying to represent.</p>

  <p>If we had input (milk, 250),<br>
    how do computer know if this is 250 bottles of milk or 250ml of milk? <br>
    You can think of it as reducing misunderstanding like above.</P>

<p>  Also, what if you put two 250ml bottles together? <br>
  You can call it 500ml by doing 250ml+250ml. <br>
  One milk bottle plus other one can be called two bottles.
  But we can express our intentions by saying, <br>
  "How many bottles do you have?" and "How many milliliters?" <br>
  In this way, we can make sure what it means to compute or represent.</p>

<p>  The same is true of everyday life. <br>
  To explain exactly what we're trying to say, <br>
  it should be stated the words are in 'which field' and 'what meaning' they contain. <br>
  There are many meanings in the word 'contain' the above sentence. <br>
  For this, it is neat to define it every time. <br>
  But it can’t because of its efficiency. <br>
  And misunderstandings are repeated.</p>

<p>  We can't explain definition for every time to say it. <br>
  Therefore, we should always keep in mind the possibility of misunderstanding. <br>
  It should be acceptable in an open position. But many people can't. <br>
  They don't even recognize misunderstandings that arise from different definitions.<br>
  They don't even seem to know that fact it can be different. <br>
  Even the word "fact" that I said 10 minutes ago and the meaning of the word "fact" <br>
  that I just said can be subtly different. <br>
  Also, you won't know accurately 100 percent without my explanation the word "fact" that I used right above.</p>

<p>  Computer language has clearly distinguished as if warning us from such a thing. <br>
  Something with defined should only be used as defined. <br>
  If there is a change, it should be marked and used as it has been. <br>
  Anyone who has spoken to many people will know. Rather, <br>
  this kind of approach may be more efficient.</p>

<p>  It's up to you to judge. I’ve been bothered by the strict distinction. <br>
  But as I grew up, I realized the importance of it. <br>
  On the way rather, I was eroded by its importance and overreacted. <br>
  Now I know it's different, and I just accept it. In a bad way, it's only 90 percent communication, not 100 percent. <br>
  It can be thought of as drawing a line. <br>
  But I'm still communicating in this way.</p>

<p>  If you want help with these judgments, <br>
  Java can help you learn how strict definitions can help.<br>
  It wouldn't be a bad idea to get the help you need to judge your values in the <a href="https://www.boostcourse.org/opencourse" target="_blank" title="Boostcourse homepage">BoostCourse</a>.</p>
