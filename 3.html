  <h2>3. Metacognition</h2>
<p>There's something my boss said.</p>
<p>Leaders should not be afraid of failure.<br>
Real failure is learning nothing form failure.<br>
A more serious failure is not taking full risk for of failing.</p>
<p>I think so, too. You shouldn't be afraid of failure, and you must learn something from it.<br>
In order to do so, there is one prerequisite. You must have to challenge with a basis. <br>
And if it failed, you must find out why you failed.<br>
  If there are something to learn from it, you failed in the challenge, but you succeeded in learning.<br></p>
  <p>Whether or not you know the reason is so important.<br>
    I failed three things today.</p>
    <p>Class files were not well created in the '5-1. Create Desktop Applications' lecture.<br>
I can't open the Raspberry Pi's kernel in the "5-2 Control of Things with Java" lecture.<br>
 And I failed to run virtual device in the '5-3 Create Android Applications' lecture.</p>
 <p>I made right class file by re-running the program.<br>
 But I still don't know why it wasn't made well.<br>
 However, I learned that I should pay more attention to the production process.</p>
 <p>The reason that I think "why I failed to open the kernel of RaspberryPi" is because there are no device.<br>
These basic problems, especially hardware, are not easy to figure out.<br>
The lecture deals with software and this is so basic hardware question that it is unclear how to ask.<br>
There are no place to explain it because it is considered natural.</p>
<p>I was looking for a reason why I couldn't run the virtual device, but I quit.<br>
Apparently, it was executed in the build window, <br>
but the error "Android studio emulator was killed" keeps popping up.<br>
It was said that it was a problem with environmental variables and disk capacity, <br>
but it is not important now.</p>
<p>In general, we think that wrong made on purpose are heavier.<br>
However, from a Buddhist point of view, they deal more heavily with the wrong they have made without knowing.<br>
This is because mistakes can be repeated over and over again.<br>
It is the story of whether it can be fixed or not.</p>
<p>Boostcourse didn't gave the answer to me about the third question.<br>
I turn on it several times, no explanation of environmental variables and disk capacity was given.<br>
Nevertheless, the first question was learned from the previous lecture, <br>
I written in the comments about second question.<br>
And I still don't know the answer to the third question, but it let me know that I didn't know.<br>
It provided an opportunity to use metacognition capabilities appropriately.</p>
<p>In that respect, the Boostcourse is excellent.<br>
Of course not everyone using the Boostcourse will do this intellectual activity.<br>
As mentioned in the second article, sometimes it is also more important to get what you want quickly and use it.<br>
But at the same time, what if we use metacognition?<br>
Wouldn't it show the speed of learning like artificial intelligence?<br>
<p>Come on and study with me at <a href="https://www.boostcourse.org/opencourse" target="_blank" title="Boostcourse homepage">BoostCourse</a>.</p>
<p>I will once again remind you of my 'study goal' and finish my writing.<br>
The goal of writing is to interest people like me.<br>
My "goal to take a lecture" is to become an "algorithm engineer."<br>
In other words, I have to think about algorithms and engineering too.<br>
You may also want to learn something through language.<br>
Someone studies English and science separately, but I acquire scientific knowledge in English.<br>
It may be slow, but there will definitely be a lot to gain.<br>
There will be a variety of things to think about, and it will be hard but not boring.</p>
