  <h2>7. Debugging</h2>

  <p>The results may not come out well in solving the problem.<br>
  Then it is important to find out which process is wrong.<br>
  Because we need to find it and fix it.</p>

  <p>If my methodology is correct, I just correct the error.<br>
  But what if the methodology is wrong?<br>
  Currently, debugging is not possible to review the methodology.<br>
  It goes on the assumption that my method is correct.</p>

  <p>Debugging can't be said to try a new ways.<br>
  It is entirely up to me to make a new attempt.</p>

  <p>I will continue to produce content for those<br>
  who are interested in English and philosophy, which is my original purpose.<br>
If you are interested, you will want to read the article just by the related keywords.
Even if it is in English.<br>
I'm making a new attempt.<br>
  At the very least, you may have never seen anything made up of text<br>
  except for pretty blogs and various photos in reviewing.<br>
  But it is like a book. Maybe it's an essential choice because it's an area that needs to stimulate your imagination.<br>
