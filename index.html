  <h2><strong><u>Caution</u></strong>, include only a minimum of course content.</h2>
<p>As you can see from the form of this blog,<br>
I really don't know anything about coding.<br>
  That's why I can write at a low level.</p>
<p>I will only introduce in this blog minimum numbers of notions mentioned in the lectures.<br>
Instead, everyday and philosophical topics that came to mind while learning Java lecture will be handle.<br>
  (Also, my English practice too)</p>
  <P>I think the above method is attractive to people like me.<br>
If you want to contact me personally, feel free to contact me anytime.<br>
