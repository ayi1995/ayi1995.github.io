  <h2>6. Creativity</h2>
<p>A program is something that allows things to happen in order. <br>
  There are countless methodologies in the world. And order is very important in methodology. <br>
  Because many methods are often becomes meaningless if the order is changed. <br>
  For example, you have to turn on the water and rub your hands to wash your hands. <br>
  If you rub your hands first and turn on the water, you can't wash your hands. <br>
  You can change this method when you have a complete understanding.</p>

  <p>If you don't have a perfect understanding, you'd better follow the order. <br>
    It gives tremendous efficiency generally when you put program to machines to do. <br>
    Because it takes a lot of time to understand. <br>
    But if you understand this, the order isn't that important. <br>
    Anyone who knows how to clean their hands, besides turning on the water and rubbing their hands, <br>
    they can come up with a new methodology, such as rubbing your hands where water is contained or wiping them on paper. <br>
    As such, it is possible to improve the process more efficiently by giving an anomaly that suits the purpose. <br>
    This is why algorithms continue to improve.</p>

  <p>Knowing properly is so important like above. <br>
    And I think artificial intelligence is currently staying at this stage. <br>
    A stage where data analysis is possible, but no reason can be known itself. <br>
    Artificial intelligence will have to go forward to know why. <br>
    And improvement through him should be possible on his own.<br>
  In other words, artificial intelligence should have meta-recognition capabilities.</p>

<p>This requires curiosity and creativity. <br>
  Nowadays, programs and algorithms can only do as they are told at. <br>
  They must mutations occur, constantly change, and improve but they can't do itself. <br>
  Someone can claim that they can improve with machine learning, <br>
  but that's not what I'm trying to say. <br>
  Mathematically, machine learning certainly approaches the limit of its answer. <br>
  However, the limit is not always the same as the value. <br>
  In other words, sometimes creative methods are needed.</p>

  <p>Of course, if it don't know some word, you can code in a program like <br>
    "If you don't know this word, collect information through a search." <br>
    But if it don't know 'what it doesn't know is?' It's very difficult. <br>
    This is why I believe that artificial intelligence will implement by random networks physically. <br>
    It should try to find words that have nothing to do with them itself. <br>
    But how do we implement this approach? <br>
    It seems to be a method that cannot be tried logically. <br>
    (Of course, put in whole human knowledge would change the story, but...)</p>

  <p>If it cannot be tried logically, it cannot be implemented by algorithms. <br>
    As I said before, it is because of the characteristics of computer language. <br>
    Of course, this is because things like creativity have not been properly defined and revealed so far. <br>
    If defined, it could be solved maybe. Are you interested in defining creativity? <br>
    Then why don't you come to <a href="https://www.boostcourse.org/opencourse" target="_blank" title="Boostcourse homepage">BoostCourse</a> and define it in computer language?</p>
