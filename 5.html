  <h2>5. Implementation of AI</h2>

  <p>This lecture is similar to the previous lecture. <br>
    So in this article, I'd like to talk about something out of the lecture. <br>
    It is the implementation of artificial intelligence physically.</p>

  <p>I don't think artificial intelligence will be implemented in software. <br>
    Software implementation is the creation of artificial intelligence with coding and algorithms.<br>
    Then what do I think it will be implemented? Of course, I think it will be implemented physically.</p>

  <p>As I mentioned in the first article, I believe that the entanglement of infinite neural networks will implement intelligence. <br>
    This is beyond algorithms such as big data processing and neural network computing. <br>
    Currently, semiconductor industry is focused on software implementation, which we implement over like NPU. <br>
    In fact, it speeds up the processing of big data and speeds up the computational process by spreading it out. <br>
    It is just a statistical mechanism.</p>

  <p>The semiconductor industry in the future will physically implement neural networks as I said. <br>
    Nowadays, this technology is called neuromorphic semiconductors in the semiconductor industry. <br>
    Regardless of the concept of increasing processing speeds and defining formulas. <br>
    It looks like a black box currently.</p>

  <p>I don't know what's going to come out before it's implemented. <br>
    But from my point of view, this is a technology that can make claim that ‘there is no reason for human’s intellect’.<br>
    Because, meaningless connections have resulted in intellect.<br>
  So, I will study graph theory and network theory after Java lecture. <br>
  Of course, if you read my article, you can feel that the reason for studying coding is fading. <br>
  Yes, I'm stopping people who want to major in computer engineering<br>
  (It’s ok to major computer science I think.). </p>
  <p>In addition to the above reasons, there are no place for computer engineers to stand in the places that computer science seeks. <br>
  Of course, implementing artificial intelligence would mean unemployment for all scholars. <br>
  According to the pace of development of computer science, <br>
  this field does not seem to be bright, unlike social perception.</p>

  <p>Then why am I learning java? We must establishment mathematical thinking through computer language. <br>
    Also I must be in there who major in computer engineering to stop them. <br>
    Above all, I told you to learn Java, never do major. <br>
    You only need develop your ability to think properly and use it.</p>

  <p>Welcome to my blog. It may be difficult, but I will recommend a <a href="https://www.boostcourse.org/opencourse" target="_blank" title="Boostcourse homepage">BoostCourse</a> for the construction of an environment where you can steadily improve your thinking ability. <br>
    If you think about yourself through my blog and BoostCourse, you will be able to take what I have told you. <br>
    I'll try a little harder to make sure your enthusiasm is on fire.</p>
