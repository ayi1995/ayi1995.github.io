  <h2>2. Practice</h2>
<p>Have you set a goal to acquire basic knowledge? Then you have to “do it” now.<br>
  There are many ways to acquire knowledge, but I distinguish it in two main ways. <br>
  Practice (external learning) and thinking (internal learning). <br>
  As you can see from the expression, 'practice' is that focuses on utilizing <br>
  what I have learned and 'thinking' is that focuses on returning, memorizing and exploring what I have learned. </p>
<p>  Knowledge like language is that needs practice. <br>
  If you want to be good at Korean, you should meet many Korean speakers and talk.<br>
  If you are reading the Korean dictionary, then you won't get much help in your Korean. <br>
  Of course, if you want to study Korean because you are curious about it, <br>
  it is necessary to think about it, but in this case, it is desirable to view it as a study rather than a language.</P>
<p>  It's like big data. Experience countless cases, and naturally find the best response.<br>
  It is ridiculous to memorize and explore the number of all cases in the use of the same or different language in some cases. <br>
  That is, we have a lot of experience to say that we are using big data in our head. </p>
<p>  Readers who read the first chapter would have recognized the strangeness. <br>
  You will have the same question as “Isn’t writer said the realization of intelligence through the use of big data is different from human intelligence?” <br>
  That's right, but we can't talk about it yet. <br>
  If there is a story related to forgetting later, I will write about it in detail. <br>
(Amazingly, machine learning can also produce results similar to forgetfulness <br>
by intentionally making the weight of meaningless elements zero. <br>
In this case, well, it seems to be quite similar to human intelligence.)</p>
<p>  The importance of language is greater than thought. <br>
  Naturally, in order to acquire learning, one or more languages must be proficient. <br>
  If you don't know at least Korean, how can you read? <br>
  And the study that can be acquired in Korean is proportional to the number of books (information) written in Korean. <br>
  In other words, more knowledge can be accessed by using languages which many people uses and writes.</p>
<p>  Then what language should we learn? Isn't English the universal language of course? <br>
  However, only half of them are right. There are many people who cannot speak English. <br>
  However, no one is bad at math. You gave up math? No, mathematics is not just a term for calculus. <br>
  Buy things, get change, buy three and triple the price. <br>
  This 'ability to write an expression' is called a mathematical ability.</p>
<p>  The computer language that is commonly known is actually mathematics itself, <br>
  and therefore computer language is equivalent to the world's common language. <br>
  That's why when it comes to learning a computer language, <br>
  we don't have to worry about the meaning and mechanism of operation such as <br>
  “public/class/static/void/main/string/println”, but we have to run the program once by copying and pasting it, <br>
  and learn the language by correcting and debugging.</p>
<p>  That's why in learning computer languages, <br>
  we need to learn the language by running a program even by copying and pasting, <br>
  correcting faulty grammar through compilation and debug, <br>
  rather than considering the meaning and mechanism of operation of public/class/static/void/string/println.<br>
  And then you will know the meaning one by one.</p>
<p>  I wrote a GitHub blog used &lt;p&gt;, &lt;/br&gt; without knowing meanings. <br>
  And I still don't know the meaning (Sorry, I’ll study more). <br>
  But I've already made a great blog, and no one would have suspected it without this paragraph<br>
  (Wow! &lt;p&lt; is abbreviation of ‘paragraph’! As you can see, you will find out when you use it).</p>
<p>  If you decide, run the program right away. <br>
  Access the <a href="https://www.boostcourse.org/opencourse" target="_blank" title="Boostcourse homepage">BoostCourse</a> site, take classes, and have time to use the language you want to learn. <br>
  Now I can only print "Hello World!!" to Java through the site. <br>
  Of course, it is possible to put another sentence in " ". It's still only a printing, but anyway I can use Java. <br>
  Through more use, I’ll become proficient in the Java, and I hope you will be as well too.</p>
