  <h2>9. To relieve the discomfort</h2>
  <p>If you can't solve the problem, you will study to solve the inconvenience.<br>
  Then, "Did we solve the problem?" and "Did you study to relieve inconvenience?" we should ask questions about.<br>
  Unfortunately, I couldn't solve such problems.<br>
  My problem is not to make an app using Java.<br>
  It is in learning through utilization.<br>
  Therefore, I am studying other things to solve this problem.</p>

  <p>This lecture threw me a lot of questions.<br>
  One of them is concern about my career path.<br>
  Through this lecture, I was motivated to start.<br>
  This problem made me study.<br>
  I started looking for information about the Neuromorphic(electronic brain) and exchanged e-mails with many Ph.Ds.<br>
  Among them were stories about graduate schools and related knowledge.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, I was able to distinguish between what I couldn't do and what I can do.<br>
  I have come to compromise with reality to a certain extent.<br>
  So I decided to study math more, and I also considered going to graduate school.<br>
  I decided to put aside direct study of the Neuromorphic(electronic brain) for a while.<br>
  However, I am very satisfied with the fact that I set up this roadmap.</p>

  <p>I think the relieve of inconvenience is a satisfactory result.<br>
  It was a good opportunity to learn about Java through the lecture,
  but I actually didn't feel much improvement in Java itself.<br>
  Therefore, I write this article. It's to say that it's okay to these people.<br>
  Because I think this is more valuable.<br>
  That's why I still recommend <a href="https://www.boostcourse.org/opencourse" target="_blank" title="Boostcourse homepage">BoostCourse</a></p>
