  <p>It's ok that if you can't make smartphone.<br>
  It's ok that you can use smartphone.<br>
  It's only half right.</p>

  <p>I don't like the expression above.<br>
  Of course, there are people who likes.<br>
  I don't mean it's wrong.<br>
  Knowing how to use it also requires some understanding.<br>
  But I want to have a perfect understanding.</p>

  <p>If I can use the library, I can do many things.<br>
  But doing a lot of things is not my goal.<br>
  If you use the library, you will understand the principles.<br>
  And I want to create a new principle.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to learn more about libraries and how to use them, go to <a href="https://www.boostcourse.org/opencourse" target="_blank" title="Boostcourse homepage">BoostCourse</a>.<br>
  Learning through utilization is a good way.<br>
  Until the day I write a book!<br>
