  <h2>10. At the end</h2>


  <p>I had time to learn basic Java usage.<br>
  But it wasn't as interesting as I thought.<br>
  Because they are so basic things.<br>
  The content itself was not interesting to me, <br>
  who wanted to know something deeper.</p>

  <p>But as intended, I threw in a lot of philosophical and inner considerations.<br>
  I think I grew up in my own way in the process of solving it.<br>
  I hope this kind of attempt was helpful to people who went the same way as me, <br>
  so I finish writing.</p>
